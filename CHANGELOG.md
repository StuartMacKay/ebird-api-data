## Latest

- Downgraded Checklist.Protocol to a StrEnum - what an epic journey this
  turned out to be! The eBird Basic Dataset v1.16 definition, reduces the
  set of protocols to 16. Three core (incidental, stationary, traveling), 
  four secondary (banding, nocturnal flight call count, eBird pelagic protocol, 
  historical), one legacy (area), with the remaining eight "descriptive", e.g.
  "Stationary (2-band: <50m, >50m)". The descriptive protocols may be referred
  to by a protocol name (eBird Basic Dataset only), e.g. 'Stationary (2-band: 
  <25m, >25m)' is referred to as 'Common Bird Survey'. This means that the names 
  for protocols may be country or project specific, which in turns means that
  the translation strings in a TextChoice class or a table will need to be 
  overridden to display a translation of the protocol name. In Django this is
  easy to do by adding a .po file with the overridden strings and add it to the
  LOCALE_PATHS setting. However, an even simpler solution is to let the project
  using this one define it's own TextChoice or mapping.

   ```python manage.py migrate data --fake-initial``` 

## 0.2.3 (2025-07-24)
